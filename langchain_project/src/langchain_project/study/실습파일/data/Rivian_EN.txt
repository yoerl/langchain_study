Founded in 2009 by MIT PhD graduate RJ Scaringe, Rivian is an innovative American electric vehicle manufacturer. Initially focused on autonomous electric cars from 2011, Rivian's significant growth phase began in 2015 with substantial investments, leading to the establishment of research facilities in Michigan and the Bay Area. To be closer to key suppliers, the company relocated its headquarters to Livonia, Michigan.

Rivian's early endeavor was the sports car R1 (originally named Avera), a mid-engine hybrid coupe with a 2+2 seating arrangement, designed by Peter Stevens. The car featured a modular capsule structure with easily replaceable body panels, and production was anticipated to start between late 2013 and early 2014. Rivian also considered various versions, including a diesel hybrid, a racing version named R1 GT for a Brazilian one-make series, a four-door sedan, and a crossover. Although a prototype hatchback was unveiled in 2011, its relation to the R1 remains unclear.

In October 2021, Rivian began delivering its first mass-produced vehicle, the R1T truck, to customers.
